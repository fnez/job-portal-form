## What I showcase with this project:

1. **Form Validation & Error Handling:** Use TypeScript for type-safe form inputs and validation.

2. **State Management:** Implement Reactâ€™s Context API or a library to manage form state across steps.

3. **UX/UI Focus:** Design a seamless user experience with clear navigation and feedback (e.g., progress indicator). This Includes media-queries for different screen sizes. 404 page.

4. **Reusable Components:** Each form step as a standalone component for easier maintenance.

5. **Thorough Commenting:** Detailed comments to show thought process for validation and state handling.

6. **Testing:** Unit tests for validation logic, component render tests, and potentially end-to-end testing for form completion.

7. **Backend API:** Use a mock backend like JSON Placeholder or Mock API for the HTTP Post requests when submitting data.
